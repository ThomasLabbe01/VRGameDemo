The current project includes :

An environment in which the user can move objects around from one table to a another. We can access an exploration mode where the user can interact with all objects, and a test mode where the user is specifically asked to move certain objects. There are currently 8 different poses that the user can make, and every object can be grabbed with 2 or 3 poses.
A tool to save data of tests is also present. The status of the grab and the position of the objects is recorded
Training with context by comparing the current pose with the available poses for the object
Vibrotactile feedback. When the user grabs an object, we can send a vibration through a bracelet
EMG sensors : the user can put on the HD-EMG sensors to controll the different poses
